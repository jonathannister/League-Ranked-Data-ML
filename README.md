# The nearest neighbors program allows you to perform a K-Nearest Neighbors on damage features from high elo league of legends games after choosing how many rows to read from the csv (where each row is one game), whether to sum the columns to have each variable appear once per team, and then whether to find the overall difference between the teams for each variable. Outputs a feature reduction on the selected features, the first 100 elements of the expected and predicted values for each game that the modle predicted, the overall accuracy, a confusion matrix of the results, and the classification report.
# The linear regreesion program allows you to perform a linear regression on damage features from high elo league of legends games after choosing how many rows to read from the csv (where each row is one game) and whether to take the difference between the teams' values for each variable. Outputs Coefficients of all the variables being looked at in the regression, the graph itself, and statistics about how well the regression went.
